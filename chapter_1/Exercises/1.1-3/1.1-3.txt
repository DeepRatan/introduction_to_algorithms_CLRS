Let's take example of an array, based on C / C++, language.

Let's most of the data structure have four basic operations.
  1.  	Insertion.
  2. 	Deletion.
  3.	Retrieve value at ith index.

Strengths
  1.	Retrieval of any value from an array has a constant time complexity.
  		Because, an array is a contiguous location and retrieval is done on (base pointer + ith location).
  2.	Insertion at back is always a constant time operation O (1).
  3.	Deletion at back is always a constant time operation O (1).
Limitations
  1.	Cannot have a variable size declared array, need to provide a constant size.
  2.	Insertion at ith place takes much time as compare to linked list which has O (1) time complexity, because an array has to reshuffle all its members.
  3.	Same with deletion as well.
